# ebbs-social

EBBS social is a social media platform running on Ethereum. EBBS is short for Ethereum Bulletin Board System.

Posts are published to the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts, fronted by an easy to use web UI.

Given that it is using a blockchain as a mechanism to store and distribute content, it makes the system censorship resistant.

There is no requirement for anyone to be identified beyond their Ethereum address when publishing content, making the system privacy friendly.

Consider this an experiment and learning exercise in what's possible to build on top of Ethereum. Time will tell if it's a good idea or not..

## Try it out

With a compatible Ethereum browser, for example using the MetaMask plugin, you can immediately start using EBBS social. Latest version deployed at [ebbs.social](https://ebbs.social).

You can also clone the [frontend repository](https://github.com/cfelde/ebbs-social-frontend) and run the UI logic locally, or deploy it to a different site if you want to.
